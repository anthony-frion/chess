# chess

This repository includes all the necessary components to play chess through a pygame window. The pieces sprites have been downloaded from https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Chess_Pieces_Sprite.svg, and the remaining of the graphics have been made by myself.

The repository will also soon include a chess 'minimax' AI that works on top of the existing code (already coded, still to be cleaned up before publication). Stay tuned ;)
